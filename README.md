# Heuristic_model_for_aquifer-aquitard_structures_in_fluvial_environments

This julia script models the formation of aquifer-aquitard structures in a fluvial setting to assist the development of groundwater flow and transport models with a more “realistic” feel. On a conceptual level, the model generates networks of meandering, coalescing stream channels, accompanied by fine-grained overbank deposits, as sediment accumulation responds to changing energy conditions over time. Layers of sedimentary deposits are stacked to form a three-dimensional domain with correlation structures that exist primarily in the horizontal (vertical correlation is limited). Rather than directly applying sediment transport equations, this model approaches the distribution of hydraulic conductivity in fluvial environments heuristically, based on a set of rules of thumb. An expanded discussion, as well as an accompanying example application, are provided in my blog, https://numericalenvironmental.wordpress.com/2018/11/06/a-heuristic-procedure-for-creating-aquifer-aquitard-structures-stemming-from-deposition-in-a-fluvial-environment/.

The script requires the julia just-in-time compiler (v 1.0). In addition, the following text input files are required:

* formation.txt - contains a list of parameters to set up correlation structures, gridding information, etc.; refer to internal comments in the code for more detail. The “formation” prefix is a user-chosen name. If only one file is provided, the specified parameters will be used to populate the entire model domain. If two formation files are listed, separate domains will be created and then merged, with the resultant two hydraulic conductivity realizations separated by an inclined fault. In this instance, the first listed “formation” - see code - will be placed above the second with respect to the z-axis.
* fault.txt - orientation in 3-D space, thickness, and intrinsic hydraulic conductivity for a fault separating the two formations, should such an option be exercised by providing two separate formation parameter sets. This file will be ignored if only a single formation is specified.

I'd appreciate hearing back from you if you find the code useful. Questions or comments are welcome at walt.mcnab@gmail.com.
